{"name":"Ratel","tagline":"Service Discovery","body":"# Introduction\r\nRatel is a library that allows us to integrate system internal components in a simple way, which hopefully enables you to provide a scalable, testable distributed platform with less effort. The basic motivation behind the library is to minimize technological overhead so that the volume of a code that does not implement actual business logic is minimal.\r\nRatel introduces a trivial abstraction of a service in a distributed environment: \r\n\r\n**_In java world service is an interface. On client side you inject an interface, on provider side you implement an interface. Nothing more.
